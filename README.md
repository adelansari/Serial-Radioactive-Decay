# Serial-Radioactive-Decay
Radioactive isotopes decay exponentially until they reach a state where no more decay takes place. This Matlab code will calculate the activity or number of atoms in a given time until they reach their final state. 
After experimenting, I concluded the total decay time may depend on the individual decay times of each isotope.
